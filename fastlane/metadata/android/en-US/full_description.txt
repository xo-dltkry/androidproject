A Material You recurring expense tracker, allowing you to keep track of your monthly spending.

As the name suggests, this app focuses on recurring expenses like rent, insurance, subscriptions, etc.
It's a simple Kotlin multiplatform app with basic functionality. My idea is to add new features iteratively and I'm happy for any contribution. Feel free to make feature requests or report bugs if you find any.
